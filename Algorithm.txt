Hierachical Inheritance - Father -> 2 sons, Both son can extend the father class

Multiple Inheritance - 2 Fathers -> 1 son, Son can extend both father class, Not use in Java

Abstract class - can't create object (Data tway ko yu chin yin extend loke pyy ya ml)
Interface ko thone chin yin implement lok ya ml
